* Lambda Expression Language Interpreter
  This is language interpreter which interprets the lamdbda expressions and literals.
  I have done this as series of assignments for my academic elective EOPL(Essentials of Programming Languages)

** This interpreter is written in Scheme which is dialect of Lisp.

* Test:
	my_reduce <exp> <env> ---- for short testing

		or

	(reduce(lookup(parse(<exp>))<env>))) -- for detail testing
